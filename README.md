# End-to-End-Data-Analytics-Project-Sales-Analysis
End-to-end data analytics: Cleaned Kaggle sales data with Pandas, loaded to PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy, and analyzed with SQL.
## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics pipeline using Python and SQL. I downloaded a sales dataset from Kaggle, performed data cleaning and processing with Pandas, loaded the data into a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy, and conducted in-depth analysis with SQL queries to uncover business insights.

### Objectives
- Clean and preprocess sales data for analysis.
- Build an ETL pipeline to load data into PostgreSQL.
- Analyze sales trends and performance using SQL, including:
  1. Identifying the top-selling product.
  2. Finding the top 5 highest-selling products in each region.
  3. Comparing month-over-month sales growth for 2022 vs. 2023.
  4. Determining the highest sales month for each product category.
  5. Identifying the sub-category with the highest profit growth in 2023 compared to 2022.
